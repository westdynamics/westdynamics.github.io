                    <h4>Artificial Intelligence Explained</h4><br>
                    <p>AI refers to the systems or machines that mimic human intelligence
                        to perform tasks and can interactively improve themselves based on 
                        the information they collect.

                                AI has become a one stop for for applications that perform complex tasks that used to
                                require human input such as playing chess and chat customer service.
                                the terms used interchangeably, include machine learning and deep learning.
                                They do have differences though theylead to one and the same. For example, machine 
                                learning is focused on building systems that improve their performance based on the 
                                data they consume.
                                Spoiler Alert!! note: although all machine learning is AI, not all all AI is machine learning

                                    Most Developers this days use artificial intelligence more,
                                     to perform more tasks that are otherwise done manually, 
                                     connect with customers, identift patterns, and solve problems.
                                     AI is based on alot of math and so to get started with it one 
                                     must confortable with math and algorithms.

                                     Building applications in AI one must always consider small and 
                                     build up top complex tasks moving steadily is definetely the way
                                      to since there is no limit to how far AI can take you.
