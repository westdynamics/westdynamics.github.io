                            then you’ve interacted with perhaps one of the most common forms of artificial intelligence 
                            permeating everyday life.

                            AI is the backbone of smart assistants, which can be accessed through most phones on the market 
                            these days and are also being integrated into cars and smart home devices. As of 2022, more than
                             120 million U.S. adults use a smart assistant at least once a month.

                            robots to be programmable machines that carry out tasks, but nobody can pinpoint exactly where
                             that definition ends.</p><br>
